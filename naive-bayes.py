# A cancer dataset considered for naive bayes implementation.It contains total 569 rows and 32 column. We shall examine malignant and benign tumors

# Naive Bayes Classifiers are classified into three categories â€”
# i) Gaussian Naive Bayes
# This classifier is employed when the predictor values are continuous and are expected to follow a Gaussian distribution.
# ii) Bernoulli Naive Bayes
# When the predictors are boolean in nature and are supposed to follow the Bernoulli distribution, this classifier is utilized.
# iii) Multinomial Naive Bayes
# This classifier makes use of a multinomial distribution and is often used to solve issues involving document or text classification.
